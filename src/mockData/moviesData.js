Even after tremendous efforts, the machine does not seem to work. Meanwhile, Raja Verma, a high-profile thief has a peculiar hobby of burglary of antique pieces from the world's museums. His henchmen steal a 16th-century diamond, belonging to the period of the Vijayanagara empire from the Salar Jung Museum. The robbery is witnessed by Kishore, a school kid who is trapped in the museum on his school excursion. He manages to escape from the robbers and gets rescued by Krishna Kumar.
