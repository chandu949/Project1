Even after tremendous efforts, the machine does not seem to work. Meanwhile, Raja Verma, a high-profile thief has a peculiar hobby of burglary of antique pieces from the world's museums. His henchmen steal a 16th-century diamond, belonging to the period of the Vijayanagara empire from the Salar Jung Museum. The robbery is witnessed by Kishore, a school kid who is trapped in the museum on his school excursion. He manages to escape from the robbers and gets rescued by Krishna Kumar. However, no one believes Kishore, and the diamond is replaced by its duplicate in the museum."
